Project Summary
The EduLMS project is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed to facilitate the online education process. Built using React.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend, it provides a modern platform where teachers can create courses and assignments, while students can enroll, submit assignments, and view their grades. The system supports role-based authentication to ensure secure access for both students and teachers.

Project Module Description
Authentication: Users can register and log in with role-based access (Student/Teacher).
Course Management: Teachers can create, view, and manage courses; students can enroll in available courses.
Assignment Management: Teachers can create assignments for their courses, and students can submit their work.
Grading System: Teachers can grade submissions and provide feedback for students.
Dashboards: Role-specific dashboards for students and teachers to manage their activities.
